            when you call a method or access an attribute in Python, 
            the Python interpreter uses something called the method
            ** resolution order to look it up ** in the class. 
            So the lookup starts in the current class, in this case Class C,
            which doesn't define the name attribute.
            So then Python looks in the superclasses in the order in which they are defined from left to right.
            So since Class A is listed first, that's why we're seeing the Class A string in the output.
