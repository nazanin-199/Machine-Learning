    *** Part 7 ***
    these magic methods help us to emulate some built in behaviour 
    magic methods are always surrounded by double underescore so called 'dunder'

    1. Your classes can override these methods to customize a variety of behavior and make them act just like Python's built-in classes. 
    2. Using these methods, you can customize how your objects are represented as strings, both for display to the user and for debugging purposes
    3. You can control how attributes are accessed on an object both for when they are set, and for when they are retrieved.
    4. You can add capabilities to your classes that enable them to be used in expressions such as testing for equality, or other comparison operations like greater than or less than.
